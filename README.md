# C3-objc
Objc runtime bindings for the C3 programming language.

This is the command line I use:
```c3c compile --target macos-aarch64 try_objc.c3 objc_runtime.c3```

Window shows up and application delegate works.

This is an example how it can be done.

Further development will be in C3-Foundation, as more and more files would need to be added.
